<p>An alloy is the  combination of two or more elements (like metals,non metals etc..).An alloy is consider as a mixture that can't be separated by physical method.</p>
<p>For Example: Brass is the alloy of 30% of zinc and 70% of copper .</p>

<p><b>Solvent:</b>The substance which dissolve another substance in it is called solvent.It is also called dispersion medium</p>
<p><b>Solute:-</b> The substance which dissolve solvent is called solute. It is also called dispersed particles.</p>
<p><b>Solution:-</b>The combination of solute and solvent forms a solution</p>

<p>The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present in the given amount of solution.</p>

<p>In the case of mass, the concentration of solution is defined as the mass of solute present in the given mass of solution.</p>
<main>concentration of solution= mass of solute/mass of solution *100</main>

<p>Numerical-1.Find the concentration of solution if a solution contains 23 grams of sugar and 234 gram of water.</p>
<pre>Solve:-Given that
    mass of solute= 23 gm
    mass of solvent=234 gm
    mass of solute= mass of solute + mass of solvent
                = 23+234=257gm
                
Now,concentration of solution= mass of solute/mass of solution *100
                              = 23/257*100
                              = 8.94% ans....

<p>3.Why air is consider as mixture and not a compound?</p>
<p>Ans:- Air is the mixture because:-</p>
<ul>
    <li>Air can be separated in its constituents by physical process.</li>
    <li>Heat and light is never given out or absorbed like in a mixture.</li>
    <li>Air show the properties of constituents present in it.</li>
    <li>Air don't have fixed boiling and melting point.</li>
    <li>Thus,air shows the property of mixture.So,it is consider as a mixture.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.Explain why water is a compound and not a mixture?</p>
<p>Ans:- Water is a compound because:-</p>
<ul>
    <li>Water has fixed boiling and melting point.</li>
    <li>Water can't be separated into its constituents by phscial process.</li>
    <li>Heat and energy is either given out or absorbed .</li>
    <li>Its constituents like oxygen and hydrogen are present in the fixed proportion of their masses of 1:8.</li>
    <li>Thus,it shows the properties of compound.So,water is a compound.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.Why allow is consider as a mixture?</p>
<p>Ans:- An alloy is consider as a mixture because the elements that make it up are physically together, not chemically combined or joined together as in a compound. </p>
<p>5.Identify the solute and solvent in 80% solution of alcohol with water. </p>
<p>Ans:If in the solution,there is 80% alcohol and 20% of water.So,solute is water and solvent is alcohol.</p>
